        With over 12 years of software development experience and a passion for blockchain technology, I am a Lead Software Engineer at
        JPMorgan Chase, where I create innovative and secure solutions for enterprise applications. I have a strong background in developing
        and deploying smart contracts on Ethereum and Quorum, designing and implementing private blockchain networks, and integrating
        blockchain solutions with existing enterprise systems and APIs.

        In my current role, I also lead the migration of multiple micro-services to AWS cloud production, using Terraform and other cloud
        technologies. Additionally, I work with various frontend and backend technologies, such as React, Kotlin, Node.js, and Golang, to
        build performant and user-friendly applications. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, communicating technical concepts
        effectively, and solving complex problems creatively. I am always eager to learn new skills and explore the potential of blockchain
        to transform various domains and industries, such as finance, supply chain, and healthcare.
